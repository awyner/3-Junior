Intro
  CIA - confidentiality (access restriction), integrity (correct and unaltered information), availability
  information security - focus more on protecting data/info, more focused
  cyber security - more broad focus, protect data, integrity of systems, detecting/responding/preventing attacks, risk management and oversight
  APT - active persistent threat
  cybersecurity posture - approach, philosophy or strategy regarding security
    initial baseline configuration
    continuous security monitoring
    emergency response plan
Malware/viruses
  types of virus - file-based and file-less
    file-based - malicious code that is attached to a file that reproduces itself on the same computer without any human intervention
    file-less - can reside on windows registry or attach to process that starts on boot and loads into memory
  computer virus - malicious code that reproduces itself on same computer
  program virus - infects program
  viruses do not spread by themselves, need user interaction to spread
  worm - malicious program that self replicates and spreads over network automatically
  bot - computer infected with malware that allows malicious actor to remotely control computer and launch attacks, scans, etc.
  malware can try to detect monitoring tools, debuggers, and virtual machines in order to evade them
  swiss cheese infection - viruses inject themselves into executable code, scramble itself, decrypt in segments
  mutation
    oligomorphic virus changes internal code to one of a set of predefine mutations whenever executed
    polymorphic virus can rewrite its own code and appear different each time it is executed
      achieve countless number of variations using obfuscation methods ,encryption, data appending
      examples: Wannacry, cryptoLocker, Virlock
  metamorphic virus
    completely changes from its original form when executed
    most infections virus
    no encryption key
    no part of the code remains constant
    never returns to original form
    no specific signature - very difficult to detect with AV
    example: Zmist
Web-apps
  XSS - website accepts user inut wihtout validating/filtering and uses that input in a response can be exploited
    Cross site request forgery (CSRF) - take a token from website A that victim is authenticated to, then the attacker gets victim to send that token/credentials to the attacker, then attacker makes request with victim's credentials
    Server side request forgery (SSRF) - persistent, sits on server and executes malicious requests using credentials of users that authenticate to server/website
  XSS Activity
    Task 1
      How many headers? 4 - General, request, response, entity
    Task 2
      How many headers - 3 x headers: x-frame-options, x-xss-protection, x-content-type-options
      Content-Security-Policy: allows whitelisting of approved sources of content, ie javascript, css
      X-Content-Type-Options : prevents chrome and internet explorer from attempting to MIME-sniff content-type of a response to one other than the MIME type declared by a server
      X-Frame-Options: protects against clickjacking attacks by preventing other sites from displaying your site in an iframe
      X-XSS-Protection: enables/disables/blocks malicious requests using a browser's built-in XSS protection
      Strict-Transport-Security: Forces browsers to use https regardless of whether they enter http or https
Attacks on software
  memory vulnerabilities - buffer overflow, integer overflow
  improper exception handling
KRI - key risk indicators, metrics of upper and lower bounds of specific indicators of normal network activity
chain of trust - check each element used in each step of the boot process has not been modified
HIDS - host intrusion detection system, can detect attack has occured
HIPS - host intrusion prevention system, monitors endpoint activity to immediately block a malicious attack following specific rules
EDR - endpoint detection and response, can aggregate data from multiple endpoints to a centralized database
mobile device risks
  tethering - mobile device w/ active internet connection can be used to hsare that connection with other mobile devices through BT or wifi
  usb on the go
  malicious usb cable
  rogue aps/public hotspots
cryptography - scrambling information so it cannot be read
steganography - hides existence of data rather than scrambling it
  divide data and hide in unused portions of the file
  may hide data in file header fields or between sections of metadata
stream cipher
block cipher - breaks plaintext into blocks, encrypts first block, merges with next block and encrypts next block until all data is encrypted
  DES, Triple DES, AES, Blowfish
three types of cryptographic algorithms
  hash
  symmetric algorithms - same key is used to encrypt and decrpt file (DES, 3DES, AES, RC, Blowfish)
  asymmetric algorithms - private key/public key pair
hierarchal trust model - assigns a single herarchy with one master CA call ed root, root signs all digital CAs with a single key
distributed trust model - multiple CAs sign digital certificates, eliminates limitations of hierarchal trust model
secure switch - disable all ports and reenable 1 by 1, enable port security and assign specific mac addresses, limit port to 1 mac address, shut down port if violated
stateless packet filtering weakness - treats each packet in isolation
VLAN - group devices not in same physical area in same logical LAN
  implements good security practices by segmenting the network
