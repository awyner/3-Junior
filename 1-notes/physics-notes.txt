a significant aspect to science is the reporting of your findings
organizing the information, explain and analyze what it means and why its relevant
describing motion
  position - the physical location of an object, made relative to some reference point
  need to have some standard for comparison
displacement - change in position - final-initial
  measurement unit with some direction
  independent of origin
vectors - physical quantities that are completely described by a number/unit and a direction
scalar - physical quantities that are completely defined by a number and a unit
Newton = kg * m/s^2
pressure = force / area - Pa(scal) = weight / area = density of fluid * g * h (depth below surface)
